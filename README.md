## My process

This is my first challenge using Frontend Mentor, and these are my first practices with HTML and CSS.
My goal was to create a solution that looks exactly like the given design. I also aimed for clean and well-structured code, making it easy to understand and use for any colleague who might need it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using Flexbox correctly and intuitively was my top priority. I'm sure I’ve learned a lot from this challenge!

### Continued development

I would like to keep focusing on HTML and CSS. After that, my goal is to use all the knowledge I’ve gained to learn JavaScript, React, and Vue.js.
